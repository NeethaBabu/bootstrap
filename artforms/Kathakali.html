<p><h2>Kathakali comes from southwestern India, around the state of Kerala. Like bharatanatyam, kathakali is a religious dance. It draws inspiration from the Ramayana and stories from Shaiva traditions. Kathakali is traditionally performed by boys and men, even for female roles. The costumes and makeup are especially elaborate, with faces made to look like painted masks and enormous headdresses. It involves colorful costumes, intricate makeup, and stylized movements to tell stories from Hindu mythology. The performers use hand gestures, facial expressions, and body language to convey emotions and depict characters. Music, singing, and percussion instruments such as chenda and maddalam are also integral to the performance.</h2></p></center>
